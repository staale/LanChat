This is a project to eventually produce a chat client for LAN networks.
The idea originated during an Open Spaces Conference, JavaPosseRoundup 2011.
Cooperating in ad-hoc networks there, it was apparent that we where missing 
some easy means to share files over the lan to people we hadn't met before.

KNOWN ISSUES:
The test case fails on deserialization when using sbt, but not
when using scalatest or running the tests from Intellij
